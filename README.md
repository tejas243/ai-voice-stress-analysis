# 🎙 AI Voice Stress Analysis System  
### Real-Time Acoustic Stress Detection Using Signal Processing & Machine Learning

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **AI Voice Stress Analysis System** is a real-time machine learning application that detects stress levels from human speech by analyzing acoustic frequency-domain features.

Instead of relying on facial expressions or body language, this system evaluates **mathematical vocal micro-patterns** that are difficult to consciously manipulate.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

Human stress often alters:
- Frequency variation
- Vocal tension
- Breathing patterns
- Micro tremors in speech

This system captures those hidden patterns using signal processing and machine learning.

## 📊 Model Details

The supervised ML model classifies speech into:

- 🟢 Low Stress  
- 🟡 Medium Stress  
- 🔴 High Stress  

The output is not just a label — it provides **confidence distribution** for interpretability.
